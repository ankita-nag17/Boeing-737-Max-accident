Studied the Boeing 737 MAX accidents, including Lion Air Flight 610 (October 29, 2018) and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 (March 10, 2019),
 which led to 346 fatalities and the worldwide grounding of the aircraft between March 2019 and December 2020– Analyzed the causes of the crashes, focusing on the role of the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), sensor failures, and
 pilot response during critical flight conditions– Reviewed Boeing’s corrective measures, regulatory interventions, and the linking of both crashes to systemic design and training issues, highlighting
 lessons learned for aviation safety
